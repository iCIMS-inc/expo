RateMyTreater,https://icims-hackathon-18.devpost.com/submissions/104767-ratemytreater,"Inspiration

Have you ever wondered whether you should bother knocking on that one door for Halloween candy? Is Old Man Jenkins giving out floss again this year? As children, this was the only thing that bothered us in Halloween. However, with ""RateMyTreater"" you can now avoid wasting time knocking on doors of people who are pretending they aren't at home and you can instead spend more time knocking on the houses with candy and loot! 

What it does

What this app does is it first finds your location, with your permission, by using your wi-fi or cell service to pinpoint where you are. If one is not connected to the internet, then their last recorded location will be used. After finding you, the app displays nearby houses on your street by using your coordinates to go through the OpenDataCage API and database. Here, you can select any house and find out what treats they're giving out and what review they have based of the information provided by other users. In addition, you can also share the love by contributing your own information on treats. 

How we built it

This app was built in android studio. Using android native functions, the app tracks the user's location (with permission) by first using the user's wifi to estimate the location of the user. If that doesn't work, the app uses cell phone towers to estimate the user's location. If that still doesn't work, the app will refer back to the user's previous location. The app then enters the user's coordinates into the OpenCageData API and returns a JSON file with nearby houses. This JSON file is then read and manipulated into displaying the closest homes on the user's street. Using FireBase, we then store any of the information inputted by the users. This database is then used to retrieve information to display to other users of the app. Information includes what treats are available and what rating people gave the house.

Challenges we ran into

The first challenge we ran into was displaying the information provided by the JSON file from the OpenCageData database. This was a problem as Android Studio doesn't allow the use of IO. This was then solved by reading and processing the information in the ""background"" of Android Studio by doing it under a class that extended the Async class. Other challenges we ran into were displaying everything in a card view, retrieving information from the FireBase database, and displaying images onto the card view.

Accomplishments that we're proud of

One accomplishment we're proud is being able to effectively use FireBase in order to store our information and retrieve it when needed. Another major accomplishment was being able to display all the needed information and images onto the card views for a cleaner look. In addition to this, we're also proud of being able to use android studio to pinpoint the user's location and retrieve information from APIs online. However, our biggest accomplishment that we are proud of is being able to make an app of this complexity in under 12 hours. 

What we learned

What we learned today was how to use FireBase and display information in a card view. In addition, we also learned to read information online in a different way and to track the user's location.

What's next for RateMyTreater

Improvements that are planned for this includes finding houses in a certain radius as indicated by the user, improve the use of photos in this app, and to be able to let the user provide more information on the treats and give more descriptive reviews.",,,,"Best Halloween Hack, Most Innovative Hack, Best Hack for Good, Most Potential for a Startup, Best use of Google Cloud Platform","openstreetmap, opencagedata, java, xml, android-studio, firestore",NaveenanYogeswaran,"Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, Princeton University",3,Advith,pintojonathan11,anthein5772,
Candiot,https://icims-hackathon-18.devpost.com/submissions/104789-candiot,"Inspiration

By leaving the bowl unattended on Halloween, there is no telling who will go for a double grab of candy.

What it does

When a trick or treater goes for the bowl twice, a proximity sensor will pick that up and trigger a spooky audio clip that is playful but threatening and an image of the culprit will be sent to the owner. This allows the owner to catch the thief and also allows for my trick or treaters to visit the house fill up their bags. 

How I built it

The team split into different sections.
An audio playback script was created with random audio clips on deck to play for a trigger. A script was also written to detect the number of people in a given picture. A couple of team members also worked trying to interface with a Dragonboard and then a Raspberry Pi in order to run these scripts based on motion and camera input hooked up to the board.

Challenges I ran into

The DragonBoard was the bulk of the work which didn't end up working. We spent hours on it trying to set it up and even had assistance from staff but that didn't seem to work as well. We migrated to the Raspberry Pi, which also offered more problems for the team. A team member also ran into laptop issues and spent half of the day fixing it. Lastly, the WiFi in the area gave the team a lot of trouble as it took way longer than expected to download and upload all necessary items.

Accomplishments that I'm proud of

We learned A LOT and are proud.

What I learned

For our first Hackathon, we learned a lot. One of these things is that not everything will go as planned as most of our day went to debugging things that we didn't think would be problems. We were ready to face script/interfacing issues but not in they fashion that they occured.

What's next for Candiot

Nut Identification Using Machine Learning,https://icims-hackathon-18.devpost.com/submissions/104735-nut-identification-using-machine-learning,"Inspiration

I am a person with severe peanut allergies. I wanted to create something that could potentially help people like me. While some people might find identifying different nuts easy, people with visual disabilities or people who have been sheltered away from an allergen might have trouble with this. I wanted to use machine learning to create something that will help people identify different types of nuts. 

What it does

Given an image of either an almond, a peanut, a walnut, a cashew, or a hazelnut, the application will identify which nut it is.

How I built it

I used the Wolfram language to tackle this problem. First I created sets of examples for each type of nut. To accomplish this, I used a web scraping technique to gather many images (about 60) for each type of nut. Next, I created a function called NutClassify that can classify the type of nut. 

Challenges I ran into

Machine learning can use up a lot of memory especially when it comes to images, so my computer kept crashing. I was able to overcome it by confining the images to a fixed specification.

Accomplishments that I'm proud of

Despite numerous challenges, including the computer crashing multiple times, I was able to successfully create a microsite for the application.

What I learned

I made the application using machine learning, but in order for it to be very effective and accurate, I need large dataset. While the classifier was trained using numerous pictures for each nut (about 60), including more pictures will certainly help. 

What's next for Nut Identification Using Machine Learning

I would like to improve the efficiency of this application by training it with a bigger dataset.

Subsequently, I would like to make it a self-learning application. Currently, I was able to get the dataset set by performing a google search and uploading the images on to Wolfram cloud. I would like to make it a self-learning solution.

It could also be improved by creating an app that does the same thing as the microsite. While the microsite can be used from a phone or a tablet, it may be easier to use an app.",,https://www.wolframcloud.com/objects/aparnakumargs/Nut-Identifier-by-Aparna-Kumar,,Most Innovative Hack,wolfram-technologies,apkumar,,0,,,,

The Need for Feed,https://icims-hackathon-18.devpost.com/submissions/104785-the-need-for-feed,"Originally, we had an idea to make a realtime map for any stores or businesses that were offering trick-or-treating. We figured that needy kids could access the map, perhaps through food pantries, and see where they could get candy on Halloween. Then, it hit us- why not apply this to food in general? So much food goes to waste every year; restaurants and hotels throw whatever is not eaten out at the end of each day. This food can go to better use, and we realized we could use our service to bridge this gap.

We have a website where businesses can post notifications when they have leftover food at the end of the day. Homeless shelters and food pantries can see such hotels and restaurants that are nearby. Businesses can also search up food pantries to see where they can send unused food.

Through HTML and CSS, we created and formatted a website on the Sublime Text Editor. We implemented APIs and widgets from Google Maps, to show nearby places, and Twitter, to show realtime updates.

It was challenging to format the webpage and bring it a clean, professional look. Also, implementing a search box for Google Maps, so one can search up nearby restaurants or food pantries, was difficult since we did not initially work it into our code.

We are proud that we created a service that can truly benefit society and do good for people who don't have ready access to food. Besides this, it reduces the amount of waste.

Our knowledge of HTML and CSS languages has substantially grown, as we discovered new functions and applications.

The Need For Feed website could use more development to make it a more efficient, capable service. Our business could be expanded into a delivery system, with sources of capital including advertising and potential government funding.",,,,"Most Innovative UX Design Hack, Best Domain Name from Domain.com, [Weekly Challenge] Best Social Good Hack from Fidelity, Best Halloween Hack, Most Innovative Hack, Best Hack for Good, Most Potential for a Startup, Best 1st-timers Hack (Students)","html, css, sublime-text, google-maps, twitter",ArujJain,,1,aksamuraifencer,,,

Meal Plan with Google assistant,https://icims-hackathon-18.devpost.com/submissions/104793-meal-plan-with-google-assistant,"Inspiration

Some of the team members meal prep for the next day and wanted a randomizer that would ensure that they would have healthy meals (sometimes).

What it does

The assistant asks the user for a calorie intake number and suggests breakfast, lunch and dinner based on that.

How we built it

Using Google's Dialogflow and javascript for the fulfillment part.

Challenges we ran into

The structure of intents are more targeted for scenarios where the user requests information and the assistant replies. In our scenario the tables are reversed. The assistant asks the user questions and the answer becomes the input to the next intent.

Accomplishments that we're proud of

That we were able to finish the MVP version we had in mind. 

What we learned

How to train the assistant with variations of a phrase, set up events and create logic to branch the conversation.

What's next for Meal Plan with Google assistant

We would like to recognize meal types (i.e. vegan, vegetarian, healthy) and suggest meals that meet the criteria. We would like to link to an API that would provide us with meals and calorie counts so that the choices would be more varied. We would also add the ability to generate a new suggestion for a specific meal in case the user doesn't have the ingredients or he/she doesn't have the ingredients. Finally we would like to be able to send a text to the user with the final meal plan.

Boogle - A spooky remake of Google.,https://icims-hackathon-18.devpost.com/submissions/104775-boogle-a-spooky-remake-of-google,"Inspiration

Google is easily the most important website on the internet, and for Halloween I thought it would be nice if it were a little bit more than that. 

What it does

Boogle is a self-made creepy ""spirit"" you can ask questions about your future and about her past.

How I built it

Built completely from scratch, in a program called Brackets, Using CSS, HTML, and JavaScript.

Challenges I ran into

Lots of components I was excited to have didn't work as expected. I spent about 1 1/2 hours on a simple design I ended up scrapping completely.

Accomplishments that I'm proud of

The Boogle logo is self made, code is self-written and characteristics of the ""spirit"" were self-thought. Each question is carefully thought out, and finding new questions is easy. Also I tried to make it as close as possible to the actual Google website, trying to be as close as possible without looking at the Google website source code. I payed extreme attention to detail. Copying even the slightest detail from the Google website that you wouldn't even notice unless I pointed it out. Also I tried my best for the website to work with all screen sizes, even though it was built on a larger screen.

What I learned

Tiny details arn't important until the program is actually functional.

What's next for Boogle - A spooky remake of Google.

Jumpscare Generator,https://icims-hackathon-18.devpost.com/submissions/104770-jumpscare-generator,"Inspiration

I'm a huge fan of horror movies, books, games, etc. and do enjoy myself a good jumpscare. But I realized there are only so many jumpscares out there, and one day I might run out of juicy jumpscares to get my heart racing! Hence, I came up with the solution to build a website that will forever generate original jumpscares. 

What it does

Jumpscares are generated based on two inputs you feed the website, one for the image and one for the sound effect. The program will search the web for the image and then the audio file, and present them to you at the same time to give you a hearty spook! Ideally, the user will search scary things like ""Exorcist baby"" and ""Psycho theme"", but it is possible to get a picture of puppies paired with Marvin Gaye's Let's Get it On.

How I built it

I wrote an HTML file with a bit of JavaScript and inserted it into a freemium domain.com website. The exact APIs I used were were the Bing API for image search (because I couldn't get the Google one to work) and Freesounds API to search for royalty-free sound files.

Challenges I ran into

I spent a couple hours trying to get the Google image search API to work before giving up and settling for Bing's service. Other than that the project went smoothly. 

Accomplishments that I'm proud of

I created (as far as I can tell) the world's first customizable jumpscare generator, which hopefully can be of interest to fellow jumpscare enthusiasts! 

What I learned

I actually learned a lot of JavaScript, and basically taught myself AJAX. Nicely, these seem like useful skills that I can use in future projects or in a future career.

Henry and I met for the first time today through a mutual friend that connected us. We're not used to working togehter so we thought we would do a classic web experience for our hackathon challenge. As we were thinking about ideas, we found this hackathon space really nice and fancy, but little drafty(cold). We thought we could offer up some good suggestions on what to wear.

What it does

We use an open weather api to find the current real feel temp and then fetch clothing suggestions through the eBay api.

How we built it

We used node.js with twitter bootstrap as the front end. We fetched data for each of the two api's and added it to our splash page. 

Challenges we ran into

We didn't have time to integrate other api's. I wanted to monetize with some referral links. Henry is still working hard on how we can get better results from the ebay api as it is because there was so many repeat results.

Accomplishments that we're proud of

We're proud because we finished this with a lot of time to spare. We have never worked together so we both were not expecting to have finished this with about 4-5 hours of work.

What we learned

We wanted to make a practical and relevant project, we wanted to use the api, one of the mentors helped us realize to think simply and efficiently.

What it does

Companies that contract iCIMS for their job postings can use Google Home to monitor how many applicants fit certain criteria(i.e., location, degree, minimum experience).

How we built it

using dialogflow to act as a middle man between the google home mini and machine functions, basically, the job posting employer can post their jobs through our website then monitor how many applicants fit the criteria that was inputted into the HTML website.

Challenges we ran into


Connecting the HTTP to python which had to connect to the HTML code
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of the fact that we finished the python code, html code, and the http section, however we still need to combine all three portions of our project.

KnowYourPresence,https://icims-hackathon-18.devpost.com/submissions/104783-knowyourpresence,"Inspiration

Everyday we use the internet we leave an online footprint. These footprints can be in the form of posts, comments, submissions, etc. It might be hard to find what exactly you have left behind on the internet and some of these footprints can be very detrimental. 

What it does

KnowYourPresence.com scans your online presence though social media posts and analyses them for sentiment. If you want to see how your posts would be seen in the eyes of potential employer, the app can tell you! Using the iCIMS Halloween API, KYP compares your posts to other job applicants of a company. We analyze the sentiment of the accepted and denied applicants so we can then compare it to yours. After you're done you can come back to the site later and compare your old sentiment analysis to your new one. 

How we built it

KYP was built with Python back-end connected to flask. We used the iCIMS API to store job interests, user details, and past applicants of a company. More information is stored on a sqlite3 server containing detailed score history and related social media accounts. Some of the sentiment is generated using the AWS sentiment analysis API and other parts are done locally. 

Challenges we ran into

Getting the front end to run asynchronous alongside the incoming tweets was really difficult. We overcame it though socket connections between the back-end python and the front-end JavaScript. 

Accomplishments that we're proud of

We created an advanced analysis app that can analyze new data and connect it to previously submitted data to create a detailed report. 

What we learned

We learned a lot about asynchronous programming and the iCIMs API. But more importantly we learned how to manage such a extensive project in such a short time. 

What's next for KnowYourPresence

In the future we want to fine-tune the asynchronous behavior and add more social media sources. Additionally, we would want to check your tweets to see if they are about current news events.",,,,"Best Domain Name from Domain.com, Best use of AWS or an Amazon Device (Students), Most Innovative Hack, Best Hack for Good, Best use of AI/ML, Most Potential for a Startup, Best use of Google Cloud Platform, Best use of iCIMS Hackathon API","icims-api, python, flask, javascript, amazon-web-services",HAMBO123,,2,danielwang404,vsolank3,,

Pumpkin,https://icims-hackathon-18.devpost.com/submissions/104757-pumpkin,"So, What's the Sitch?

""Dad can you help me get a lot of candy?"" - Little Johnnan

How can the new generation of parents, who are experienced mobile app users, have a way to optimize their time to provide their children with the best trick-or-treating experience. Favourite candies, plethoras of decorations, and haunted mazes are the treats of halloween, meanwhile houses that have run out of candy or do not participate in halloween are the tricks. 

What is Pumpkin

Pumpkin grants users with access to a map view of their location and allows them to pan around and see houses marked with such tricks and treats. Parents and children can now optimize their time by skipping out on these boring houses and focus on finding their favourite candies and the best decorated houses.

How WE built it

This is an iOS mobile application developed using Xcode and Swift. We are using MapKit to display a map view and importing databases using MySql.

The Future of Pumpkin

The seasonal nature of this app is a quite a shame! Especially when this same technology could used to support other neighborhood level events and businesses. The Pumpkin development team would love to use our app to promote fundraisers, charity/donations, garage/yard sales, lemonade stands, block parties, and snow shoveling jobs for kids in the winter.",,,,"Best Halloween Hack, Most Potential for a Startup","ios, swift, mysql, php, mapkit, xcode",jmonzone,College of Staten Island of the City University of New York,2,vincentvitiello527,mvitebsky,,

What it does

We have created this project to help them while buying foods or other products or even knowing what kind of product is in front of them. Any person can use this handy tool and help us make it better. 

How we built it

Scraped a lot of images from the web.
https://github.com/DivyendraPatil/google-images-download

Train a CNN (Convolutional Neural Net) using a scraped images using Google's Open Source ML Tool ""Tensorflow"".


High-Quality Images from google search filtering for better efficiency of the model being created. In our case, we achieved an accuracy of 80.7%.


The model we created is based on CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) like google’s Inception-v3 model on GPU instance. The model used was for Image classification with 40 diverse food items, with about 100 images for each category with 10% of them as the training set with 22 levels with 8000 set as maximum training cycles.

Imported the model files generated by Tensorflow on GCP into an Android application using Tensorflow SDK. 
Used NDK for C++ code base for detection which computes faster than Java code thus enabling lag-free calculation using GPU supports.

The images were converted to Numpy array of size 299 x 299 from 720p video frames captured from phone’s camera. Deciding on a threshold of 51% thus not having confusion among two categories by applying minimum distance required for decision set as 10%.

Used TTS (Text To Speech) service for letting the user know what food item has been detected. JNI code base used extensively for such purposes.

Locale Support for different languages has been provided by using Google’s Translate API for initialization. Hence, providing non-network dependent machine learned application.

Challenges we ran into

Not being able to sleep doesn't seem much when your code keeps crashing. And when you know that it is because of a corrupt file which you are parsing for Machine Learning, there is not much you can do than just shake your head.

Accomplishments that we're proud of

I'm proud of not attempting to incorporate any of the sponsor companies' APIs just to be eligible for their prizes because that would have caused unnecessary complexity and distracted me from achieving the main goal.

What we learned

Sometimes give other people to look at your code as a second eye.

What's next for Food Detect

Get funding for the same.
AWS can be utilized for training many images quickly

TrackOrTreat,https://icims-hackathon-18.devpost.com/submissions/104776-trackortreat,"Inspiration

With the Halloween season on the horizon, parents throughout the country are going to be taking their children to strangers houses within their community. Due to the unknown nature of the character of people and what they are doing with the candy or even how they behave in front of children parents have resorted to having trick or treating in parking lots. We want children to have fun and go door to door collecting as much candy as they can while their peace have the peace of mind that the neighborhood they will be taking their children to is safe. 

What it does

The web application displays a location and the user can select individual houses or entire neighborhoods and select a safety rating and a general overview of their experience while trick or treating with their children. The ultimate goal is to have a website that parents can use and share their experiences with each other and check on past/current experiences before visiting a particular house or neighborhood.

How I built it

By using here.com's API we implemented an interactive map on a website provided by domain.com. We attempted to implement a back-end with a server on one of our computers using docker, PHP and SQL.

Challenges I ran into

Back-end coding has been very challenging for our group. Sadly, none of our members are familiar with PHP, docker or SQL, nor here.com's API

Accomplishments that I'm proud of

Figuring out here.com's API, creating a functional domain, working together as a team, figuring out so much in completely new terrains using API's and back-end coding. Completing our teams' very first hackathon. Having a team that never argued with each other and every member putting forth maximum effort to attempt to get our code completed. Most importantly, coming together as a team and having a great time on a Saturday coding and learning so much in Computer Science

What I learned

Every member in our team did something new today, members learned how to create a server with their own PC, how to use PHP, learning here.com's API some members learned how to code in JavaScript and HTML/CSS. 

What's next for TrackOrTreat

TrackOrTreat needs some polishing in order to be nationwide and effective. For example, the back-end needs to work more properly and its ability to process data is very limited.

Argyle Events - Alexa Skill,https://icims-hackathon-18.devpost.com/submissions/104786-argyle-events-alexa-skill,"Inspiration

I love to create, develop and code projects. I've wanted to create a skill for the organization I work for, Argyle Executive Forum, for some time. During the week, I'm lucky enough to work on the sales side. I connect advertisers with our members, composed of C-Suite (CFOs, CHROs, CMOS, CIOS, CISOS) and their direct reports. At our events, we raffle off Amazon Echo Dots. I believe having a presence on the Amazon Skills Store would be beneficial for the organization. 

What it does

This skill allows anyone to find out and learn about our upcoming events. 

Challenges I ran into

At the begininng of the hackathon, I was thinking about an entirely different project. Based upon iCIMS' CTO remarks, ""build something, make sure you have running code and then adjust it,"" I thought this would be good for this project. 

What I learned

It's easy to crank out an idea solo (not too many disagreements in the project), however, working with one other person (or two) would have been easier to bounce ideas off of.

Challenges we ran into

There were a lot of bugs, including a bug where Alexa wouldn't register our response as a command.

Accomplishments that we're proud of

It took one of us three hours to sort out the biggest bug in the program. We also used some of Alexa's machine learning algorithms to register most sentences into a valid collection.

What we learned

We learned a lot more about Python and how to make skills for the Amazon Alexa.

What's next for The Discord-Alexa Link

It will notify the user upon the mentioning of their account.
